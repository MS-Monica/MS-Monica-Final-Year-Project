  IOT BASED GAS LEAKAGE DETECTION<br>
 <h2> The main objective of this project is to build a existing IoT device is related to kitchen, room vehicles
but not related to industry. Mainly for hazardous gases or it's components. Sending message using NodeMCU
module</h2>
</h1>
<br>
<br>
<h3>Aim and Objective</h3>
<p>Our proposed system detects the smoke, alcohol, and automatically pumps the solution resided in the
container and reduce the content of gases in the atmosphere. These applets consist of a trigger (the “if this”
part) and an action (the “then that” part). For example, if the temperature sensor detects a certain temperature
(trigger), then the air conditioning turns on (action). IFTTT can be used with the Arduino IoT Cloud to
integrate IoT projects with other services and devices, such as Twitter, Instagram, and Philips Hue light. This
allows for greater automation and customization of IoT projects.<p>
  
<h4>* To improve the existing system using IoT technology</h4>
<h4>* To reduce the workload of industries to detect the fault.</h4>
<h4>* We are supposed to learn the concept of IoT and how it can be utilized to work on different sectors.</h4>
